Simon Game
===========================================================
Welcome to the classic Simon Game.
The goal of the game is to repeat a sequence played by the computer 20 times.

How To Play
===========================================================
In the first round 1 button is played, in the second round 2 buttons are played and so on.
If the player makes a mistake at any point the game ends.
If the player plays 20 rounds successfully, the game ends with a player win.

Strict Mode Off
===========================================================
When the strict mode is off, the "Strict Mode" button color will be red.
In normal mode (no strict mode), if the player loses the game the sequence from the previous game plays again.

Strict Mode On
===========================================================
When the strict mode is on, the "Strict Mode" button color will be green.
In strict mode, if the player loses the game a new random sequence will be played in the new game.
