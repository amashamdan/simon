Simon Game
===========================================================
Welcome to the classic Simon Game.
The goal of the game is to repeat a sequence played by the computer 20 times.

How To Play
===========================================================
In the first round 1 button is played, in the second round 2 buttons are played and so on.
If the player plays 20 rounds successfully, the game ends with a player win.

Strict Mode Off
===========================================================
When the strict mode is off, the "Strict Mode" button color will be red.
In normal mode (no strict mode), if the player plays the sequence incorrectly, a warning message appears telling the player a wrong sequence was played.

The player can click (Try Again) to return to the game without restarting. The computer will replay the last sequence.

Strict Mode On
===========================================================
When the strict mode is on, the "Strict Mode" button color will be green.
In strict mode, if the player plays the sequence incorrectly the game ends. A message anouncing the result will appear.

The player can start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button, and the computer starts a new random sequence from scratch.
